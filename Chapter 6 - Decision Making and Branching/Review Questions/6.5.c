6.5 Assuming x = 10, state whether the following logical expressions are true or false:
(a) x == 10 && x > 10 && !x

False (because x > 10 is false).
(b) x == 10 || x > 10 && !x

True (because x == 10 is true).
(c) x == 10 && x > 10 || !x

False (because x > 10 is false, and !x is also false).
(d) x == 10 || x > 10 || !x

True (because x == 10 is true).
