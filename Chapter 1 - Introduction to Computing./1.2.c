1.2 Algorithm and Flowchart to Find the Roots of a Quadratic Equation
A quadratic equation is in the form: ax² + bx + c = 0.

Algorithm:
1.Start
2.Input values of a, b, and c.
3.Compute the discriminant: D = b² - 4ac.
4.If D > 0, compute roots using x = (-b ± √D) / 2a.
5.If D = 0, compute the single root using x = -b / 2a.
6.If D < 0, print "No real roots."
7.Display the roots.
8.Stop.

Flowchart:
Start → Input a, b, c → Compute D = b² - 4ac → Check D:
If D > 0, compute and display two roots.
If D = 0, compute and display one root.
If D < 0, display "No real roots".
Stop
