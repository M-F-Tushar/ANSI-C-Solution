/*Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to compute the simple
interest on principal P, rate R% and duration T years.

1.3 Algorithm and Flowchart to Compute Simple Interest
Formula:
Simple Interest SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Algorithm:
Start
Input P (Principal), R (Rate of Interest), T (Time in years).
Compute SI = (P × R × T) / 100.
Display SI.
Stop.
Flowchart:
Start → Input P, R, T → Compute SI = (P × R × T) / 100 → Display SI → Stop.
