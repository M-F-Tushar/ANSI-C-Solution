/*Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to compute the amount
accrued if a sum of P is invested at a rate of R% for a duration of
T years, where the interest is compounded every year.

1.4 Algorithm and Flowchart for Compound Interest
Formula:
Amount A = P(1 + R/100) ^ T
Compound Interest CI = A - P

Algorithm:
Start
Input P, R, T.
Compute A = P(1 + R/100) ^ T.
Compute CI = A - P.
Display CI.
Stop.
Flowchart:
Start → Input P, R, T → Compute A → Compute CI = A - P → Display CI → Stop.
