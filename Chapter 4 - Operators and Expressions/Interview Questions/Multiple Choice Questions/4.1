What will be the value of x and y after the following statements are executed?
x = 5;
y = x++ + ++x + x++;
Explain the logic while calculating the answer.


Answer:
To evaluate this expression, we need to carefully analyze how the post-increment (x++) and pre-increment (++x) operators work in C.

Step-by-Step Execution:
Initial Value of x:
x = 5.
Breakdown of the Expression:
The expression is:
y = x++ + ++x + x++;
First Term (x++):
Post-increment means the current value of x (which is 5) is used in the expression, and then x is incremented by 1.
So, the first term contributes 5, and x becomes 6.
Second Term (++x):
Pre-increment means x is incremented first, and then its new value is used in the expression.
Since x is now 6, it is incremented to 7, and the second term contributes 7.
Third Term (x++):
Post-increment means the current value of x (which is 7) is used in the expression, and then x is incremented by 1.
So, the third term contributes 7, and x becomes 8.
Final Calculation:
Adding up the contributions:
y = 5 + 7 + 7 = 19
Final Values:
x = 8 (after all increments).
y = 19.
Explanation of Logic:
The key here is understanding the difference between post-increment and pre-increment :

Post-increment (x++) uses the current value of x in the expression and increments x afterward.
Pre-increment (++x) increments x first and then uses the updated value in the expression.
