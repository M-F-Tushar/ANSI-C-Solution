Multiple Choice Questions

4.1 Which of the following is not an arithmetic operator?
Options:
(a) %
(b) /
(c) *
(d) All of the above are arithmetic operators
Answer:
(d) All of the above are arithmetic operators
Explanation:
All the listed operators (%, /, *) are indeed arithmetic operators in C. The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division, / performs division, and * performs multiplication.

4.2 Which of the following is an assignment operator?
Options:
(a) =
(b) %=
(c) /=
(d) All of the above
Answer:
(d) All of the above
Explanation:
All the listed operators (=, %=, /=) are assignment operators. The simple assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable, while compound assignment operators like %=, /=, etc., perform an operation and assign the result to the variable.

4.3 Which of the following statements is correct about increment and decrement operators?
Options:
(a) A prefix increment operator first adds 1 to the operand and then the result is assigned to the variable on the left.
(b) A postfix decrement operator first assigns the value to the variable on the left and then decrements the operand.
(c) The precedence and associativity of ++ and -- operators are the same as those of unary + and unary -.
(d) All of the above are correct.
Answer:
(d) All of the above are correct
Explanation:
(a) is correct because the prefix increment (++x) increments the value first and then uses it in the expression.
(b) is correct because the postfix decrement (x--) uses the current value of x in the expression and then decrements it.
(c) is correct because the precedence and associativity of ++ and -- are indeed the same as unary + and -.


4.4 Which of the following operators has the lowest level of precedence?
Options:
(a) %
(b) &
(c) &&
(d) ?=
Answer:
(c) &&
Explanation:
Among the given options, the logical AND operator (&&) has the lowest precedence. The modulus operator (%) and bitwise AND (&) have higher precedence than logical AND (&&). The conditional operator (?=) is not a valid operator in C; the correct conditional operator is ?:.


4.5 Which of the following operators is used to determine the size of the operand?
Options:
(a) auto
(b) size
(c) sizeof
(d) &
Answer:
(c) sizeof
Explanation:
The sizeof operator is used to determine the size (in bytes) of the operand or data type. For example:
int x;
printf("%zu", sizeof(x)); // Outputs the size of an integer
