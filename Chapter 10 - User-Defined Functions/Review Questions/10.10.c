A function to divide two floating point numbers is as follows:
c
Copy
Edit
float divide (float x, float y) {
    return (x / y);
}
Find the output of these function calls:
Function Call	Output
divide(10, 2)	5.0
divide(9, 2)	4.5
divide(4.5, 1.5)	3.0
divide(2.0, 3.0)	0.66667
ðŸ“Œ Reason:

Since x and y are floats, the result is a floating-point division.
