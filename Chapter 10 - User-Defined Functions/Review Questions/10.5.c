What is prototyping? Why is it necessary?
✅ Answer:

Function Prototyping
A function prototype declares a function before its definition.
It informs the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters.
✅ Example:

c
Copy
Edit
int sum(int, int);  // Function prototype
Why is it necessary?
Ensures proper function calls
Prevents errors by checking parameters
Allows functions to be defined later
