3.4.Write a program to do the following:
(a) Declare x and y as integer variables and z as a short integer
variable.
(b) Assign two 6 digit numbers to x and y
(c) Assign the sum of x and y to z
(d) Output the values of x, y and z
Comment on the output.


#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int x, y;
    short z;

    x = 123456;
    y = 654321;

    z = x + y;

    printf("x = %d\n", x);
    printf("y = %d\n", y);
    printf("z = %d\n", z);

    // Comment: Since z is a short integer, it may not be able to hold large values.
    // This could lead to overflow and incorrect results.
}
