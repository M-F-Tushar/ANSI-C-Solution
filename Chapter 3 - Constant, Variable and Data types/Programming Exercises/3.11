3.11 Write a C program to input the distance traveled by a car and the fuel consumed. Next, compute the mileage of the car.

#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    float distance, fuel, mileage;

    printf("Enter the distance traveled (in km): ");
    scanf("%f", &distance);

    printf("Enter the fuel consumed (in liters): ");
    scanf("%f", &fuel);

    mileage = distance / fuel;

    printf("Mileage of the car: %.2f km/l\n", mileage);
}
