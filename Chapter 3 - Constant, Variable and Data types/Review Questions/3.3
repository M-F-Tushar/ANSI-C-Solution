#### **3.3 What is the difference between declaring and defining a variable?**

- **Declaration** tells the compiler about the name and type of a variable but does not allocate memory for it. For example:
  ```c
  extern int x; // Declaration
  ```
- **Definition** allocates memory for the variable and may also initialize it. For example:
  ```c
  int x = 10; // Definition
  ```
