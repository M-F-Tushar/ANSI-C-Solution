Copy
Edit
struct Point {
    int x, y;
};
(c) typedef keyword
Used to define an alias for a data type:

c
Copy
Edit
typedef struct {
    int x, y;
} Point;
(d) sizeof operator
Returns the size (in bytes) of a data type or variable:

c
Copy
Edit
printf("%lu", sizeof(int)); // Outputs 4 (usually)
(e) Tag name
The name given to a struct definition (e.g., struct Student â†’ Student is the tag name).
