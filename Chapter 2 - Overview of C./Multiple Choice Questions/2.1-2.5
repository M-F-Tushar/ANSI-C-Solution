2.1 Which of the following characterize the typical features of C language?**
(a) High level
(b) Machine independent
(c) Structured
(d) All of the above
Answer: (d) All of the above
Explanation: C is a high-level language, meaning it is closer to human language than machine language. It is also machine-independent, meaning programs written in C can run on different types of computers with little or no modification. Additionally, C is a structured language, which means it supports the use of functions and blocks to organize code.


2.2 A typical C program comprises the following sections:
• A - Documentation
• B - Definition
• C - Link
• D - main ()
• E - Subprogram section
• F - Global declaration

Identify the correct sequence of the C program sections:

Answer: (b) A, C, B, F, D, E
Explanation: The typical structure of a C program is as follows:
1. Documentation Section (A): Comments about the program.
2. Link Section (C): Includes header files like #include <stdio.h>.
3. Definition Section (B): Defines constants using #define.
4. Global Declaration Section (F): Declares global variables and functions.
5. main() Function Section (D): The main function where program execution begins.
6. Subprogram Section (E): User-defined functions called in the main function.



**2.3 Which of the following types of errors are detected during program compilation?**
(a) Syntax
(b) Logical
(c) Data
(d) All of the above

**Answer:** (a) Syntax
**Explanation:** During compilation, the compiler checks for **syntax errors**, which are mistakes in the structure of the code (e.g., missing semicolons, incorrect use of keywords). **Logical errors** and **data errors** are not detected during compilation; they are runtime errors that occur when the program is executed.

**2.4 Consider the following C statements:**
A: `a-b; x -1; z-a+x;`
B: `a-b;x-1;z-a+x;`

**Which of the above programming styles are correct in C?**
(a) A is correct, B is incorrect
(b) A is incorrect, B is correct
(c) Both A and B are correct
(d) Both A and B are incorrect

**Answer:** (c) Both A and B are correct
**Explanation:** In C, spaces around operators and semicolons are optional. Both styles are correct, but style A is more readable because it uses spaces to separate statements.

**2.5 C language comprises ______ number of keywords.**
(a) 32
(b) 16
(c) 64
(d) 128

**Answer:** (a) 32
**Explanation:** ANSI C has 32 keywords, such as `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `while`, etc. These keywords have predefined meanings and cannot be used as variable names.
