2.1 State whether the following statements are true or false.

(a) Every line in a C program should end with a semicolon.
Answer: False
Explanation: Only executable statements end with a semicolon. Lines like #include, #define, and comments do not require a semicolon.

(b) The closing brace of the main() in a program is the logical end of the program.
Answer: True
Explanation: The closing brace } of the main() function marks the end of the program's execution.

(c) Comments cause the computer to print the text enclosed between /* and */ when executed.
Answer: False
Explanation: Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not produce any output.

(d) Every C program ends with an END word.
Answer: False
Explanation: C programs end with the closing brace } of the main() function, not with an END word.

(e) A printf statement can generate only one line of output.
Answer: False
Explanation: A printf statement can generate multiple lines of output using escape sequences like \n.

(f) The purpose of the header file such as stdio.h is to store the source code of a program.
Answer: False
Explanation: Header files like stdio.h contain declarations of standard input/output functions, not the source code.

(g) A line in a program may have more than one statement.
Answer: True
Explanation: Multiple statements can be written on a single line, separated by semicolons.

(h) Syntax errors will be detected by the compiler.
Answer: True
Explanation: Syntax errors are detected during compilation.

(i) In C language, lowercase letters are significant.
Answer: True
Explanation: C is case-sensitive, so lowercase and uppercase letters are treated differently.

(j) main() is where the program begins its execution.
Answer: True
Explanation: Execution of a C program starts from the main() function.

(k) Every C program must have at least one user-defined function.
Answer: False
Explanation: A C program must have a main() function, but it does not need user-defined functions.

(l) Declaration section contains instructions to the computer.
Answer: False
Explanation: The declaration section declares variables and functions but does not contain executable instructions.

(m) Only one function may be named main().
Answer: True
Explanation: A C program can have only one main() function.

(n) Comments serve as internal documentation for programmers.
Answer: True
Explanation: Comments help programmers understand the code.

(o) In C, we can have comments inside comments.
Answer: False
Explanation: Nested comments are not allowed in C.

(p) Use of comments reduces the speed of execution of the program.
Answer: False
Explanation: Comments are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the program's execution speed.

(q) A comment can be inserted in the middle of a statement.
Answer: False
Explanation: Comments cannot be inserted in the middle of a statement; they must be placed before or after the statement.
