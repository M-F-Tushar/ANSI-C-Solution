âœ… 12.14 Are these function definitions equivalent?

a) void search(int* m[], int x)
b) void search(int** m, int x)
Answer: Yes, they are equivalent.

Explanation:
In C, an array of pointers (int* m[]) is treated the same as a pointer to a pointer (int** m). Both can be used to pass a 2D array (or array of pointers) to a function.
