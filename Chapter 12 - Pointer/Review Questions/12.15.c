âœ… 12.15 Do the declarations

char s[5];
char *s;
Represent the same? Explain.

Answer: No, they do not represent the same.

char s[5]; declares a character array of size 5. Memory is allocated for 5 characters.

char *s; declares a pointer to a character, which can point to any memory location storing characters.

So, s[5] has allocated memory while *s only points to some location.
