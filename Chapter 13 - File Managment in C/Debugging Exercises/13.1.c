DEBUGGING EXERCISES
13.1 Find error, if any, in the following statements:
FILE fptr;
fptr = fopen (‚Äúdata‚Äù, ‚Äúa+‚Äù);

‚úÖ Given Code:

FILE fptr;
fptr = fopen("data", "a+");
‚ùå What‚Äôs wrong?
The declaration of fptr is incorrect.



FILE fptr;
This creates a FILE structure, not a pointer to a file.

The function fopen() returns a pointer to FILE, not a FILE directly.

So when you write:

c
Copy code
fptr = fopen("data", "a+");
You're trying to assign a FILE* to a FILE, which is invalid.

‚úÖ Correct Version:


FILE *fptr;
fptr = fopen("data", "a+");
üîç Explanation:
FILE *fptr; declares a file pointer, which is what fopen() returns.

"a+" mode opens the file for both reading and appending.

üí° Tip:
Always check if the file opened successfully:


if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening file!\n");
    exit(1);
}
