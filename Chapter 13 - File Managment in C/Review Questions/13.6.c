âœ… 13.6 Distinguish between the following:
(a) getc vs getchar:

getc(fp) reads from a file.

getchar() reads from standard input (stdin), equivalent to getc(stdin).

(b) printf vs fprintf:

printf() outputs to console.

fprintf(FILE *fp, ...) outputs to a file.

(c) feof vs ferror:

feof(fp) checks if end of file has been reached.

ferror(fp) checks if an I/O error has occurred during operations.
